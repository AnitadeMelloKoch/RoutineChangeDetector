Feedback:
Nicholas:
	Having difficulties with calculating audio MFCC's on the device. In order to progress with the application development, the MFCC's will be calculated on a
	server. This issue can be re-visited.

	User interface was also discussed. Should be incrementally developed following Agile practices.

Anita:
	Doing anomaly detection using multiple different types of algorithms. 
	Feedback from Prof Aharonson: need to decide between false positives and false negatives, and which is more acceptable.
		(FOR SVM) Also suggests that many models like to use non-linear models, even though the linear is easiest to implement.
